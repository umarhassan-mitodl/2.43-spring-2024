Applications include second-law efficiencies and methods to allocate primary energy consumptions and CO\u2082 emissions in cogeneration and hybrid power systems, minimum work of separation, maximum work of mixing, osmotic pressure and membrane equilibria, metastable states, spinodal decomposition, and Onsager\u2019s near-equilibrium reciprocity in thermodiffusive, thermoelectric, and electrokinetic cross effects.",
