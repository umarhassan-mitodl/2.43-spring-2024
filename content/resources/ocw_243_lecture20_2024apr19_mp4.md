    \nThis lecture covers: Chemical kinetics. Collisions and Arrhenius activation\
    \ energy. Principle of detailed balance. Affinity as degree of disequilibrium.\
    \ Entropy production as product of affinity and reaction rate. DoD build-up in\
    \ supersonic nozzle expansion. CO2 power laser.\n\nInstructor suggests to set\
    \ viewing speed at 1.5 for faster learning.\n\nSlides for this lecture: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-43-advanced-thermodynamics-spring-2024/resources/mit2_43_s24_lec20_pdf/\n\
