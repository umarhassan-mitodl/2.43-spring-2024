    \nThis lecture covers: Potential energy surface. Transitional state and activated\
    \ complex. Affinity of a reaction. Nonequilibrium law of mass action for ideal\
    \ and nonideal mixtures and solutions. Affinities vanish at chemical equilibrium.\
    \ Complete chemical equilibrium.\n\nInstructor suggests to set viewing speed at\
    \ 1.5 for faster learning.\n\nSlides for this lecture: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-43-advanced-thermodynamics-spring-2024/resources/mit2_43_s24_lec19_pdf/\n\
