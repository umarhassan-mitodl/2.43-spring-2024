    \nThis lecture covers: Definition of heat interaction. First and second law efficiencies\
    \ of heat engines, refrigeration units, heat pumps. Stable equilibrium properties\
    \ (temperature, pressure, heat capacities, coefficients of isothermal compressibility\
    \ and isobaric expansion). \n\nInstructor suggests to set viewing speed at 1.5\
    \ for faster learning.\n\nSlides for this lecture: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-43-advanced-thermodynamics-spring-2024/resources/mit2_43_s24_lec05_pdf/\n\
