    \nThis lecture covers: Henry law. Lennard-Jones binary mixture model. Stability\
    \ and miscibility gap. Liquid-liquid spinodal decomposition. Energy and entropy\
    \ balances for open and closed systems with chemical reactions. Bond strength\
    \ versus van der Waals force.\n\nInstructor suggests to set viewing speed at 1.5\
