  caption: Energy versus entropy diagrams are used extensively in this course to illustrate
    effectively many fundamental concepts about nonequilibrium states as well as thermodynamic
    equilibrium. This picture is used in lecture 9 to show the important role played
    by wall rarefaction effects in determining thermodynamic equilibrium properties
    of small systems. (Image courtesy of Prof. Gian Paolo Beretta.)
