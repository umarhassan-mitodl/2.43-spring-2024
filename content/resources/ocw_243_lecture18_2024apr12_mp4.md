    \nThis lecture covers: Stoichiometry. Proportionality relation. Reactions of formation.\
    \ Hess relation. Fictitious ideal gas state at standard temperature and pressure.\
    \ Heating values and exergy of hydrocarbons. Adiabatic flame temperature. Unattainability\
    \ of a reversible flame.\n\nInstructor suggests to set viewing speed at 1.5 for\
    \ faster learning.\n\nSlides for this lecture: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-43-advanced-thermodynamics-spring-2024/resources/mit2_43_s24_lec18_pdf/\n\
