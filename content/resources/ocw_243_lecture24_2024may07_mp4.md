    \nThis lecture covers: Energy and entropy carried by photons (electromagnetic\
    \ radiation). Thermoelectric effects in solid conductors. Seebeck effect, the\
    \ thermocouple, and the thermoelectric generator. Peltier and Thomson effect.\n\
    \nInstructor suggests to set viewing speed at 1.5 for faster learning.\n\nSlides\
