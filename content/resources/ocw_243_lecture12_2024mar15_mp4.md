    \nThis lecture covers: Mixture properties from partial properties. Properties\
    \ of mixing. Lennard-Jones potential and the ideal gas. Ideal Gibbs-Dalton behavior\
    \ and Dalton law. Mixtures of ideal gases. Amagat law. Entropy of irreversible\
    \ mixing. Work from reversible mixing.\n\nInstructor suggests to set viewing speed\
